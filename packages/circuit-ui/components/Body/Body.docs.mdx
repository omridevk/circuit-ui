# Body

<Status.Stable />

Body is used to present the core textual content for our users. They are contained within headlines and subheadlines
and have five different variants `highlight`, `quote`, `success`, `error` and `subtle` to tailor it according to the content we are
presenting.

- **Do** use different variants of the body component
